How Being Imperfect and Stop Hesitating Help to Learn and Improve Skills

I went for my workout at Anytime Fitness Gym on Friday Evening a time with less crowd, as usual i started my work out and today it’s chest and shoulders time, i was working hard and heard a person doing jumping ropes.A curious person inside me woke up and was telling me to try jump ropes and hesitant person inside me was telling not to try, the fight went for few minutes this time curious person won the battle and i started jump ropes.

Tak, Tak Done and Tak Tak Done, maximum i was able to do only twice in a row because i was trying to be perfect so that people don’t judge me.Here he comes a guy (Drew) who was doing jump ropes he suggested me that the ropes that i am using is very small and to look for ropes which when folded should be of height of from my shoulder to the ground and the one that i was using was 2 inch lesser.I took his suggestion and started looking for ropes based on his suggestion.I didn’t found one, Drew gave his own ropes.

I tried with the new ropes and i was still the same it was not about ropes it was about me who was hesitating and trying to be perfect.Then curious person in me told to go in front of the mirror and try.I was very optimistic and i want to try.I went near the mirror and made some area for me for practicing rope jumps by moving the benches.I was trying to do jump ropes and i was still the same was not able to find my mistake.Hesitant person in me was feeling that people are watching and it was true.Here comes one more guy(James) to help me and he suggested me to “Slow Down the Pace”.

I took james’s suggestion and i was trying to slow down now, am still doing the same 2 jumps in a row because i don’t know what to slow down and my hesitant person never asked what to slow down.I tried for a while and nothing worked out rather i was slowing down either my ropes swings or my jumps not both at a time.Again James came to me and should me how to do it and told me it’s all about rhythm and now i got some energy this time i want to try it doesn’t matter what others think.Let me try.

Here we go i started making three to five it’s a good improvement for the beginner.I tried few different way to practice better rope swing using the wrist by just slowly walking with the jump rope now i got a technique to better my rope swing skill.Then i tried slow jog with ropes and it worked too.Now it’s time i need to try real rope jumps and i stood in one place and started doing in the rythm and slowly.Now i was really better able to do 10 to 12 jumps in a row.I was really happy.I just went to Drew and James to thank them and i mentioned that i did 10 + jumps at a time.They mentioned that to try few more, i took the suggestion and went back to training area.

In this process of learning jumping ropes, small try of not being perfect, coming out of comfort zone and stop hesitating helped me to get two new amazing friends Drew and James with the great lessons to take further in my life.

Don’t try to be perfect all the time, it’s ok to be imperfect and try new things and fail.
Don’t hesitate ask questions and learn from others, people want to help, will help for sure.(Majority of the people will help)
It’s good to be out of comfort zone, it’s ok if people watches you there are lot of people just want to help you more than they want judge you.
